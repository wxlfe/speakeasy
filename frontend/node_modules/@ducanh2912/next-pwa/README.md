> **NOTE 1** - `next-pwa` version 2.0.0+ should only work with `Next.js` 9.1+, and static files should only be served through the `public` directory.
>
> **NOTE 2** - If you encounter the error `TypeError: Cannot read property **'javascript' of undefined**` during build, [please consider upgrading to Webpack 5 in `next.config.js`](https://github.com/shadowwalker/next-pwa/issues/198#issuecomment-817205700).
>
> **NOTE 3** - `@ducanh2912/next-pwa` currently doesn't support Turbopack, but I will start working on it as soon as we get our hands on Turbopack. It may not use Workbox anymore depending on [Workbox's maintain status](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/workbox/issues/3149), however.
